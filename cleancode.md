## Clean Code


 __3-Laws of TDD__ :
 
Rule - 1 : You may not write any production code without a failing unit test first 

Rule - 2 : Write only enough test code as is sufficient enough to fail (not compiling=failing) usage of undeclared class 

Rule - 3 : Only write a minimal code that makes the failing test pass. declare the class only



Test code is as important as production code. Make it readable
Clean tests folllow 5 other rules as FIRST
Fast(runs quickly) Independent(should not depend on each other) Repeatable(All environments) Self-Validating(boolean output fail or pass)  Timely(before production code) 


In a multithreaded application, two or more threads access a shared resource at the same time the results are confusing.
This situation is caled a rece condition. To overcome this problem we use  synchronized  keyword for the resource
to implement a mutex we use synchronized  keyword. Only one thread can access a resource at a time.
